Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. 
I have chosen "Titanic data" to do this assignment.
I downloaded it from Kaggle site. Link to the same is : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

My key interests would be:

1. Does Pclass played a role in survival ?
2. Does Gender has an impact on survival rate ?
3. What % passangers are board from each place ?
4. Does Embarked has any impact on survival ?

File Descriptions
titanic.csv contains columns like Survived, Pclass,	Name, Sex, Age,	SibSp,	Parch,	Ticket,	Fare, Cabin, Embarked.
I have chosen a few columns out of these and done some focused analysis.
There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my four questions.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available above. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
